#Design Concepts


Overall my concept was to be minimalistic and informative. I wanted to have enough space so that users wouldn't feel like the space was cluttered. Taking a page from Jakob Neilsens article I wanted to focus on making it highly usable and explain what is was here for. Also, to emphasize the important elements I felt would impact the user more because they would find what they are looking for quickly. Furthermore I wanted to use their advise to only use meaningful graphics that are revenant to the site. Ultimately I want to create a responsive site and believe that doing the navigation the way that I did it would best accomplish that. 

Visually a lot of my current graphic design inspiration has come from sites that have more of a darker design feel. By using black as the base you are able to see all of the other elements of the page that are in white a lot easier. Below are some examples. My favorite of these are Studio Brave and Uber.

The next example follows my original plans to have a more basic site with more with darker imagery. I love that all of the information is on one page and their use of outlined text boxes to keep information contained in one place.
